This project was developed as part of the course "Fundamentals of Python Language for Data Analysis and Data Science" offered by Data Science Academy (DSA).

The objective is to answer 10 business questions based on a dataset about a retail chain that sells various products in multiple cities across the United States.

We will analyze the data and then answer these 10 questions:

• Business Question 1:
Which city has the highest sales value for products in the 'Office Supplies' category?

• Business Question 2:
What is the total sales per order date?
Present the result using a bar chart.

• Business Question 3:
What is the total sales by state?
Present the result using a bar chart.

• Business Question 4:
What are the top 10 cities with the highest total sales?
Present the result using a bar chart.

• Business Question 5:
Which segment had the highest total sales?
Present the result using a pie chart.

• Business Question 6:
What is the total sales by segment and by year?

• Business Question 7:
Company managers are considering applying different discount tiers and would like to run a simulation based on the rule below:
If the sales value is greater than 1000, apply a 15% discount.
If the sales value is less than or equal to 1000, apply a 10% discount.
How many sales would receive a 15% discount?

• Business Question 8:
Considering the company applies the 15% discount mentioned in the previous item, what would be the average sales value before and after the discount?

• Business Question 9:
What is the average sales per segment, per year, and per month?
Present the result using a line chart.

• Business Question 10:
What is the total sales by category and sub-category, considering only the top 12 sub-categories?
Present everything using a single chart.
